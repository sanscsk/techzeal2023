      <td>Today the e-commerce space not only holds multi-product platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, etc. but also all types of retailers- big or small, regional or international, multi-product or single product which try to sell online.

To initialize the pipeline, the definition of the task is required as well as the
        summarization identifier.
