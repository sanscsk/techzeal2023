      <td>Intelligent AI Resume Screening</td>
      <td>Today, recruiters spend less than one minute looking at each resume. Why? Because for every job requirement, the average recruiter screens hundreds of resumes, searching for the ideal candidate. In Human Resources (HR), talent acquisition is a big, complicated, and time-consuming activity. The size of the Indian market is very huge. Not only do thousands of people join the workforce every month, but the attrition rate is also significant. India has the largest percentage of workers who are actively seeking a new job. Even though it is a vast and liquid market, there are a few unpleasant inefficiencies. The lack of a standard CV format and style is the most difficult component, which makes shortlisting potential profiles for the desired positions tiresome and time-consuming. Effective resume screening demands subject experts to assess the fit and applicability of a profile to the post. Shortlisting is difficult due to the wide range of career opportunities available today, as well as the enormous number of applications received for the human resource department. The possibility of eliminating irrelevant profiles as quickly as possible in the process saves money and time. The biggest issue facing the business today is how to discover the best people with minimum resources, through the internet, and in a short amount of time. To introduce efficiency to the whole process, one primary difficulty must be addressed. i.e Knowing that applicants can execute the job before the company employs them. The foregoing issues are solved by automating the process of identifying the correct resume from enormous databases of resumes, regardless of how the resume was written, and generating a list of resumes that best suit the recruiter's job description. In the offered solution, algorithms are
        employed to rate resumes.
