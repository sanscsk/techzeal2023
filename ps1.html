      <td>Air Quality Monitoring & Weather Forecasting System</td>
      <td>Air pollution represents a serious environmental problem. Each year, millions of premature deaths are attributed to air pollution, with huge economic consequences. Furthermore, air pollution is detrimental to ecosystems, damages property, impacts visibility and haze, and threatens food and water security. Air Quality Forecasts, if they are reliable and sufficiently accurate, can play an important role as part of an air quality management system The air quality (AQ) Forecast lets the public know expected air quality conditions for the next 72 hours so that Government authorities can take action to manage the air quality and issue health advisories. Local air quality affects how you live and breathe. With the help of Weather API, we can get immediate access to local weather conditions and upcoming forecasts, It will Provide real-time notifications about prevailing and expected weather conditions. which helps governments and local administrations prepare for natural disasters and save lives.
</td>
      <td>Prediction of the air quality is of at most importance. So, building a Machine Learning model that can predict Real-Time Air Quality & that is reliable and sufficiently accurate, can play an important role as part of an air quality management system. Participants can make use of any SDK to create a web Interface.
1.Build a Machine Learning model that can predict Real- Time Air Quality
2.Integrate the model with UI(User interface
