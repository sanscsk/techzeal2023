      <td>Emerging trends like increasing service demand, shifting focus towards 360-degree well-being, and rising costs of quality care are propelling the adoption of new technologies in the healthcare sector. Medical emergencies could arise at any time. From identifying symptoms to scheduling surgeries, a patient might need anything at any time.  All medical professionals might not be able to always tend to everything.
